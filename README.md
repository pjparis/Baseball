Baseball, the Pythonic way. The game is based on the old(er) dice baseball games that were popular in the early to mid-20th century with a touch of Action-Strategy Baseball (the board game) thrown in to make things a bit more interesting. 

At the moment, the game is under development, and that development has come to an effective halt as I search for an elegant way to handle baserunners and baserunner tracking. Once an algorithm is either identified or devised I'll return to more regular updates of the game.

Stay tuned...
